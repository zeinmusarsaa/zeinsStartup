 I have added only testing to the file

 For some reason I get some error sometimes but other times I do not. This change resulted in me just printing hey to see if I would get an error

 I have made various edits to conflicttest because of the assignment and a few more to learn more accurately how to handle merge conflicts. I have also added a notes.md file to my github repo.
 

## Middle-Eastern Recipe Hub
 For my application idea, I wanted to create a Middle Eastern Recipe Hub. The reason behind my idea comes from a few things. Firstly, as a college student away from home, it is hard for me to get in contact with my family often enough to have them teach me certain recipes. This way, I can learn on my own. Secondly, other than a few cookbooks and a facebook page, there aren't many applications or websites that have a collection of various recipes for middle-eastern dishes. There is a large variety in middle eastern food, and each region has influenced certain dishes differently. Through creating this application, I am able to list out different recipes, and varieties for specific dishes.
 
 
For this application, I would like to create different features in order to make it user friendly:

1. **Profile Page with posted recipes by the user, ability to edit old posts.**
2. **Page that allows to look through posts as though it is a newsfeed**
3. **Adding a page that filters posts based on dish name**
4. **Messaging Board**
5. **Nearest Middle-Eastern Market Locater**
