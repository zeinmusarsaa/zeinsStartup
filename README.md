 I have added only testing to the file

 For some reason I get some error sometimes but other times I do not. This change resulted in me just printing hey to see if I would get an error

 I have made various edits to conflicttest because of the assignment and a few more to learn more accurately how to handle merge conflicts. I have also added a notes.md file to my github repo.
 

## Middle-Eastern Recipe Hub

**Introducing the Middle Eastern Recipe Hub, the ultimate application for people looking to share and learn about Middle Eastern Recipes. With this app, you can post your favorite dishes, comment on other's posts, add and message friends. You can also search for Middle Eastern Markets near you! Participate in a lively application where you can connect about food-related discussions. The sleek and modern design will be easy to navigate, join us on a culinary journey through the Middle East!**

- The reason behind my idea comes from a few things. Firstly, as a college student away from home, it is hard for me to get in contact with my family often enough to have them teach me certain recipes. This way, I can learn on my own. Secondly, other than a few cookbooks and a facebook page, there aren't many applications or websites that have a collection of various recipes for middle-eastern dishes. There is large variety in middle eastern food, and each region has influenced certain dishes differently. Through creating this application, I am able to list out different recipes, and varieties for specific dishes. This application will also have a social aspect to it, you can view posts, comment, message and even favorite certain recipes!
 
 
For this application, I would like to create different features in order to make it user friendly:

1. **Profile Page with posted recipes by the user, ability to edit old posts.**
2. **Page that allows to look through posts as though it is a newsfeed**
3. **Adding a page that filters posts based on dish name**
4. **Messaging Board**
5. **Nearest Middle-Eastern Market Locater**

**To see how this application would look like, here is the link [Profile Page.pdf](https://github.com/zeinmusarsaa/zeinsStartup/files/11410123/Profile.Page.pdf)**
