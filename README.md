 I have added only testing to the file

 For some reason I get some error sometimes but other times I do not. This change resulted in me just printing hey to see if I would get an error

 I have made various edits to conflicttest because of the assignment and a few more to learn more accurately how to handle merge conflicts. I have also added a notes.md file to my github repo.
