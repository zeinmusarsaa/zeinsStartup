 I have added only testing to the file

 For some reason I get some error sometimes but other times I do not. This change resulted in me just printing hey to see if I would get an error

 I have made various edits to conflicttest because of the assignment and a few more to learn more accurately how to handle merge conflicts. I have also added a notes.md file to my github repo.
 

## Middle-Eastern Recipe Hub

**Introducing the Middle Eastern Recipe Hub, the ultimate application for people looking to share and learn about Middle Eastern Recipes. With this app, you can post your favorite dishes, comment on other's posts, add and message friends. You can also search for Middle Eastern Markets near you! Participate in a lively application where you can connect about food-related discussions. The sleek and modern design will be easy to navigate, join us on a culinary journey through the Middle East!**

- The reason behind my idea comes from a few things. Firstly, as a Palestinian student away from home, it is hard for me to get in contact with my family often enough to have them teach me certain recipes. The time zone difference means that I am at work when they are having dinner, then I am at school when they're going to bed. This way, I can learn on my own. Secondly, other than a few cookbooks and a couple of facebook pages, there aren't many applications or websites that have a collection of various recipes for middle-eastern dishes. It's a one-stop Middle Eastern recipe application. There is large variety in middle eastern food, and each region has influenced certain dishes differently. Through creating this application, I am able to list out different recipes, and varieties for specific dishes. This application will also have a social aspect to it, you can view posts, comment, message and even favorite certain recipes!
 
 
For this application, I would like to create different features in order to make it user friendly:

1. **Profile Page with posted recipes by the user, ability to edit old posts.**
2. **Page that allows to look through posts as though it is a newsfeed**
3. **Adding a page that filters posts based on dish name, region, and type**
4. **Messaging Board and adding friends (as well as suggested friends)**
5. **Nearest Middle-Eastern Market Locater (Google Maps)**

**Here are a few depictions or mock-up drawings of what the page will function and look like:**

**Technologies that will be used:**
1. **Authentication:** This part of the app will be used in order to access the application features. You will have a sign up page on the homepage wich will take you to a confirmation page. You will also have a login page as well, you can log in through google or facebook.
2. **Database Data:** This application will display a rendering of Middle-Eastern dishes stored in the database. This database will keep uploading based on the posts. Users can search for recipes based on name, dish type, and region of the dish. You are also able to favorite recipes, which will be displayed on your profile page.
3. **WebSocket Data:** This application will provide real-time updates of posts on the Recipe Navigator page, real time updates of your own posts on the 'My Recipe's' page, as well as provide real-time updates on Middle-Eastern Markets near the user's location based on the ZIP code which can be edited through the profile page.

**HTML, JS, and CSS:**
1. I will use HTML in creating the structure and format of my webpage, defining the structure in headers, footers, and content areas.
2. I will use CSS in the design of my website, I plan to have different images for foods, people will be able to post and input their own images, and all that will be styled through CSS.
3. I will use Java in the interactive aspect of my site, because this is like facebook/ME recipes, I will use java in the posting, filtering, commenting and messaging aspect of my application. I will also use java for my user log-in/signup part.





For my HTML startup deliverable, I added a lot to my webpage.
