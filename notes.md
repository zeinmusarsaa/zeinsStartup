**Hoping This Works**

**GITHUB Repo**
*In this lesson, I learned how to linux-style code in github, or make edits to files in the repo. I learned how to clone a repo and some functions that I could us.*

*I learned how to change fonts, the way text looks and embedding links as well!*

Here is a link to my [README File](https://github.com/zeinmusarsaa/zeinsStartup/blob/main/README.md)

 Today, I was able to sketch out an application idea.

Today, I forked the HTML structure provided for us in the assignment, I change table values, added links and images. Although I had done this before, it was  great refresher. Some things I need to remember is table elements, as well as linking both actual websites and images.
 Today, I was able to alter CANVAS, add or change an image, change a video with the <video> titles rather than the iframe provided on youtube. I need to remember how videos are only added in specific formats, like mp5 and webm and ogg.
Today, I learned how to code a website from scratch. Although I have done this previously, we never went into detail about formatting or actually inputting into the actual website. I also used code from previous homework we had to add files. I added a few more pages, added a sign in and sign up page as well. I also Iframed the google maps but hopefully in the future I would like it to be tailored to a user's specific address. My index file is my login page, in the future I want this page to be more of a welcome page and the login to the side. Once we start doing CSS this would work. I added some styling CSS code to the HTML, I went through some tutorials and from w3schools on how to better format a page.

For today, I did the assignments due on Thursday. I started by forking the codepens and making edits. There were some things I didn't know how to do and looked at the example forks in all 3 assignments. I also fixed things according to what I would perfer on my webpage. I am excited to implement these CSS structures into our startup websites next week.

For the CSS startup assignment, I created multiple CSS pages as every one of the pages on my website will be changed and altered according to what it is.

For my profile page, I added profile sections within my css code, using what I learned in class as well as what I learned through W3schools and other resources. I also looked for different ideas on CodePen and learned how to implement them.

 For my other pages, I created their own css page, I have modified it accordingly and plan on changing some CSS elements in all my css pages to include updates to code, differences for each page, and other parts of CSS
 
 Few things I need to remember:
 1. How to make sure the window is responsive to resizing (text-align).
 2. Make sure how to make the footer stay down rather than float up.
 3. Make sure that the way I format my HTML code is the way I want it to look (Had a few formatting issues because when doing the HTML startup assignment I didnt add <main> </main> to my code
 4. Different design elements.
 

 For the assignment due tomorrow for Java, I attempted to code this on my own, with a few pointers from the github page and the deepdive. When I finished, I looked at the possible solution and condensed some of my code. For example, I had to const functions and then did a console.log(testAll(input,test)) when I could've calculated the result with one const and called it as the possible solution offered. 
I implemented object classes with constructors and connect methods
