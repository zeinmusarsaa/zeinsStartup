**Hoping This Works**

**GITHUB Repo**
*In this lesson, I learned how to linux-style code in github, or make edits to files in the repo. I learned how to clone a repo and some functions that I could us.*

*I learned how to change fonts, the way text looks and embedding links as well!*

Here is a link to my [README File](https://github.com/zeinmusarsaa/zeinsStartup/blob/main/README.md)

 Today, I was able to sketch out an application idea.

Today, I forked the HTML structure provided for us in the assignment, I change table values, added links and images. Although I had done this before, it was  great refresher. Some things I need to remember is table elements, as well as linking both actual websites and images.
