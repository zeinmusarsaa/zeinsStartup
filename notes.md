**Hoping This Works**

**GITHUB Repo**
*In this lesson, I learned how to linux-style code in github, or make edits to files in the repo. I learned how to clone a repo and some functions that I could us.*

*I learned how to change fonts, the way text looks and embedding links as well!*

Here is a link to my [README File](https://github.com/zeinmusarsaa/zeinsStartup/blob/main/README.md)

 Today, I was able to sketch out an application idea.

Today, I forked the HTML structure provided for us in the assignment, I change table values, added links and images. Although I had done this before, it was  great refresher. Some things I need to remember is table elements, as well as linking both actual websites and images.
 Today, I was able to alter CANVAS, add or change an image, change a video with the <video> titles rather than the iframe provided on youtube. I need to remember how videos are only added in specific formats, like mp5 and webm and ogg.
Today, I learned how to code a website from scratch. Although I have done this previously, we never went into detail about formatting or actually inputting into the actual website. I also used code from previous homework we had to add files. I added a few more pages, added a sign in and sign up page as well. I also Iframed the google maps but hopefully in the future I would like it to be tailored to a user's specific address. My index file is my login page, in the future I want this page to be more of a welcome page and the login to the side. Once we start doing CSS this would work. I added some styling CSS code to the HTML, I went through some tutorials and from w3schools on how to better format a page.

For today, I did the assignments due on Thursday. I started by forking the codepens and making edits. There were some things I didn't know how to do and looked at the example forks in all 3 assignments. I also fixed things according to what I would perfer on my webpage. I am excited to implement these CSS structures into our startup websites next week.

For the CSS startup assignment, I created multiple CSS pages as every one of the pages on my website will be changed and altered according to what it is.

For my profile page, I added profile sections within my css code, using what I learned in class as well as what I learned through W3schools and other resources. I also looked for different ideas on CodePen and learned how to implement them.
